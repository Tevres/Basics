# Basics

A simple C++ project created with Visual Studio for testing out stuff.

## PrintUtils - helper functions for debug output in C++
This small helper module provides a collection of useful `print` functions to quickly and readably output frequently used data structures such as `vector`, `set`, `map` or directory trees to the console.  The functions are encapsulated in a separate file and can be easily integrated into any project.

## Project structure

- `Basics/` – Contains source code (`.cpp`) and project files (`.vcxproj`)
- `.gitignore` – Filters out temporary files
- `Basics.sln` – Visual Studio solution

## Build instructions

1. Open project in Visual Studio (`Basics.sln`)
2. Compile in `x64` debug mode
3. Executable file is created in `x64/Debug/` (local, not in the repo)
